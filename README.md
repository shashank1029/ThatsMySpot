Thats my spot is an app that tracks availability of parking spots using geolocations and feedback from users. It is specifically implemented for New York, where there is no sensor data available and parking rules are quite complex. It recommends the closest available parking spots to a user according to their current location. It also allows them to remember where they parked and analyze their parking habits.
